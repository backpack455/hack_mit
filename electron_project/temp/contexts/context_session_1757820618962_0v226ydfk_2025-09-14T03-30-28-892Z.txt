Fix Screenshot Display in Session History

The app is now running and ready to capture screenshots with circular gestures. Both text extraction and visual descriptions will be powered by Claude, providing much better accuracy than the previous OCR + Gemini combination.

Task 3 of 3 done

Perfect! The complete Anthropic Claude integration is now working successfully. Both text extraction and visual descriptions are now powered by Claude instead of the previous OCR + Gemini combination.

✅ Integration Complete

Your screenshot processing now uses:

• Claude for text extraction - More accurate than traditional OCR

• Claude for visual descriptions - No more quota limit issues

• Unified API - Single service for all image processing

The app is running and ready to capture screenshots with circular gestures. Both the overlay interface and Session History will now show much more accurate text extraction and descriptions powered by Claude's superior vision capabilities.

Try capturing a screenshot to see the improved accuracy in action!
