AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the interface of VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning), which appears to be a web application or software platform. The interface has a dark theme with a navy blue background.

**Key Elements:**
- Header with VIPR logo and navigation tabs: "Study" (currently selected/highlighted in gold), "Work", and "Research"
- Central branding area displaying the VIPR logo (an eye-like symbol) and full name
- Main content area showing a "Session History" panel
- The session history section is currently empty, displaying "No sessions yet" with the message "No sessions available for the selected mode"
- Target/bullseye icon in the session history area

**Purpose:** This appears to be the main dashboard or starting page of the VIPR platform, likely used for visual intelligence analysis or research tasks. The "Study" mode is currently active, and users would typically see their previous work sessions listed in the history panel once they begin using the application.
