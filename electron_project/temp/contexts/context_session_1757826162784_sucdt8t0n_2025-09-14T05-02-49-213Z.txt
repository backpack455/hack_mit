AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) web application interface. The application appears to be a research or study tool, as evidenced by the navigation tabs at the top showing "Study," "Work," and "Research" options, with "Study" currently selected.

The main content area displays a "Session History" section with a circular target-like icon and the message "No sessions yet" along with "No sessions available for the selected mode," indicating this is likely a fresh session or empty state.

The interface has a dark theme with a navy blue background. Multiple browser tabs are visible at the top, suggesting this is part of a larger workflow. The VIPR branding appears both in the browser tab and as a logo with tagline in the main interface. This appears to be an educational or research platform designed for visual reasoning tasks, currently in an initial state with no previous session data.
