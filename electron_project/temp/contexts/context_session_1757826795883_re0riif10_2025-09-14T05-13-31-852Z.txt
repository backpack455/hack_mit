AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the main interface of VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning), which appears to be a web-based application or platform. The interface features a dark theme with a prominent VIPR logo and branding at the top center.

Key visible elements include:
- Navigation menu with "Study," "Work," and "Research" tabs (Study is currently selected)
- VIPR logo with an eye-like symbol
- Main content area displaying a "Session History" panel
- Empty state message showing "No sessions yet" with explanatory text "No sessions available for the selected mode"
- Target/bullseye icon in the session history area

The application appears to be designed for academic or professional use, likely involving data analysis, research, or learning activities given the navigation options. The current view shows an empty session history, suggesting this is either a new user account or the beginning state of the application before any work sessions have been created.

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows a development environment with a VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface. The left panel displays a VS Code-style file explorer showing an "electron_project" with various JavaScript service files in the services folder, including contextAnalysisService, agentMatchingService, and others.

The main interface shows VIPR's dark-themed UI with three navigation tabs: Study, Work, and Research (Study is currently active). The center displays a "Session History" panel showing "No sessions yet" with a circular loading icon, indicating no previous sessions are available for the selected mode.

At the bottom, there's a terminal showing some console output related to gesture detection and app functionality. The overall context suggests this is a development environment for an AI-powered application that involves multiple services for tasks like agent matching, context analysis, and content processing. The interface appears to be built using Electron framework based on the project structure.
