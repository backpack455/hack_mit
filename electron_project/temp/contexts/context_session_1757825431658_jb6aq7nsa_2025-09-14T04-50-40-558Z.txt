AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the main interface of VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning), which appears to be a web-based application or platform. The interface features a dark theme with a navy blue background and golden/yellow accent colors.

Key visible elements include:
- A top navigation bar with "VIPR" branding and three menu options: "Study" (currently active/highlighted), "Work", and "Research"
- The VIPR logo (an eye symbol) prominently displayed in the center
- The tagline "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning" beneath the logo
- A "Session History" panel in the lower portion showing "No sessions yet" with the message "No sessions available for the selected mode"

This appears to be the home or dashboard page of the application, likely used for data analysis, research, or intelligence work. The empty session history suggests this is either a new user account or the user hasn't created any sessions in the currently selected mode yet.
