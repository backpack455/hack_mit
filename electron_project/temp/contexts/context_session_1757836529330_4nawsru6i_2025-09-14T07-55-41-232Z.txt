AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows Visual Studio Code (VS Code) displaying the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface. The IDE shows a project structure in the left sidebar with various JavaScript files and folders including services, electron processes, and other development assets.

The main content area displays VIPR's welcome screen with its logo and tagline. Below that is a "Session History" panel showing "No sessions yet" with the message "No sessions available for the selected mode," indicating this is likely a fresh installation or new project setup.

At the top are three mode buttons: Study, Work, and Research, with "Study" currently selected. The bottom of the screen shows VS Code's integrated terminal with some debugging output related to screenshot capture functionality.

On the right side, there appears to be a chat or conversation panel, suggesting VIPR may be an AI-assisted development or research tool. The overall interface suggests this is a development environment for an intelligent reasoning application.
