AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface running in what appears to be VS Code or a similar development environment. 

**Key elements visible:**
- VIPR branding with an eye icon logo at the top
- "Session History" panel in the center showing "No sessions yet" with a circular loading/empty state icon
- Left sidebar displaying a file explorer with search results (13 results in 6 files) including various JavaScript files with "claude-" prefixes
- Navigation tabs for "Study," "Work," and "Research" modes
- Bottom terminal showing debug messages about screenshot capturing
- Right side panel with partially visible text about model errors and fixes

**Purpose:** This appears to be a development/debugging interface for an AI-powered visual analysis tool, likely used for automated reasoning or computer vision tasks. The empty session history suggests the application is ready to start processing but hasn't begun any analysis sessions yet.

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the main interface of VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning), a web-based application or platform. The interface features a dark blue gradient background with a clean, modern design.

**Key Elements:**
- Top navigation bar with "VIPR" branding and three tabs: "Study" (currently active/highlighted in gold), "Work", and "Research"
- Central VIPR logo with an eye symbol in gold/yellow
- Tagline: "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning"
- A "Session History" panel/widget in the center-lower portion

**Current State:**
The Session History section displays "No sessions yet" with explanatory text "No sessions available for the selected mode," accompanied by a circular target-like icon. This suggests the user hasn't started any sessions or activities yet.

**Purpose:**
This appears to be the home/dashboard screen of an intelligence or analysis platform, likely used for visual data analysis, research, or educational purposes, with the current view focused on study-related activities.
