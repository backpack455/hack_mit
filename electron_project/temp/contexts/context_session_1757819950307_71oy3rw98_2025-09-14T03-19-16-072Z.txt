AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface. It appears to be a desktop application with a dark blue gradient background and a sleek, modern design.

**Key Elements:**
- Top navigation bar with "VIPR" branding and three tabs: "Study" (currently selected/highlighted in gold), "Work", and "Research"
- Central VIPR logo with tagline "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning"
- Main content area displaying a "Session History" panel

**Session History Panel:**
- Shows "No sessions yet" with a circular target-like icon
- Subtitle reads "No sessions available for the selected mode"
- Contained within a dark rounded rectangle overlay

**Purpose/Context:**
This appears to be the main dashboard or home screen of VIPR, likely an AI or analytical tool for visual intelligence tasks. The user is currently in "Study" mode but hasn't created any sessions yet, suggesting this is either a new installation or a fresh user account.

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface. It appears to be a web-based or desktop application with a dark blue gradient background.

**Key Elements:**
- Top navigation bar with "VIPR" branding and three menu options: "Study" (highlighted in gold), "Work", and "Research"
- Central VIPR logo with tagline "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning"
- Main content area displaying a "Session History" panel
- Empty state message showing "No sessions yet" with explanatory text "No sessions available for the selected mode"
- Circular target-like icon in the session history area

**Purpose & Context:**
This appears to be the home/dashboard screen of VIPR, likely an AI or analytics tool focused on visual intelligence and reasoning. The user is currently in "Study" mode but hasn't created any sessions yet. The interface suggests this is a productivity or research application that manages different types of work sessions across multiple modes (Study, Work, Research).

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, displaying a Node.js/JavaScript project. The main content area shows an `ImageLinkExtractorService.js` file with code for extracting text from images using what appears to be Claude AI (Anthropic's model "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620").

Key visible elements include:
- File explorer on the left showing project structure
- Code editor with syntax highlighting displaying an async function that processes images
- A detailed prompt for text extraction from images with specific instructions
- Terminal/console output at the bottom showing debug messages about gesture detection and screenshot capturing
- File acceptance dialog showing "8 of 11 edits" with Accept/Reject options
- Right sidebar indicating "VIPR" status and session history features

The code appears to be part of a larger application that processes images and screenshots, possibly for automated text extraction or AI-powered image analysis. The terminal output suggests real-time gesture detection and screenshot functionality is active.

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the main interface of VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning), which appears to be a web-based application or platform. The interface features a dark theme with a navy blue gradient background.

Key visible elements include:
- A navigation bar at the top with "Study," "Work," and "Research" tabs, with "Study" currently selected
- The VIPR logo (an eye symbol) and branding prominently displayed in the center
- A "Session History" panel on the right side of the screen
- The session history shows "No sessions yet" with explanatory text stating "No sessions available for the selected mode"

The application appears to be designed for some form of visual analysis or reasoning tasks, likely involving study sessions or research activities. The clean, professional interface suggests it's an educational or research tool, currently showing an empty state where no previous sessions have been created or are available in the selected mode.
