AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows the Dedalus documentation website, specifically displaying a code example for a "Web Search Agent" use case. The interface appears to be a developer documentation platform with a dark theme.

**Key elements visible:**
- Left sidebar navigation with sections like "Getting Started," "Examples," and various use cases including "Web Search Agent" (currently selected)
- Main content area showing Python code for an AI agent implementation
- Code includes imports from `dedalus_labs.utils.streaming`, async function definitions, and configuration for research tasks about AI agents
- The code shows a 5-step research workflow including finding news articles, academic papers, startup companies, GitHub repositories, and summarizing trends
- Configuration includes OpenAI GPT-4.1 model and MCP servers for semantic search and privacy-focused web search

**Purpose:** This appears to be documentation demonstrating how to implement an AI-powered web search agent using the Dedalus platform, likely for developers learning to build AI research assistants.

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows a Google Docs document interface with the title "Untitled document". The document contains technical instructions for creating an AI agent pipeline system. 

Key visible elements include:
- Standard Google Docs toolbar with formatting options (File, Edit, View, etc.)
- Document tabs panel on the left showing "Tab 1" 
- Main content area with text describing:
  - A pipeline to detect effective agentic tools for specific tasks
  - Instructions to use Claude AI for context analysis and task recommendations
  - Code snippets showing Python-like syntax with async functions, imports from "dedalus_labs", and API calls
  - A specific example query about researching AI agent developments for 2024

The document appears to be technical documentation for building an automated system that can analyze contexts and recommend appropriate AI agent tools. The content includes both high-level descriptions and specific implementation details with code examples.

**Main document content:**
I want you to create a pipeline that detects what sort of agentic tool is most effective for the task at hand given the context. We want to anticipate what sort of tasks you have next and assist the user in completing that task agentically.

I want you to take the a lot context file and provide it to Claude, and ask the question "Based on this context, provide the best 3 automation tasks that would help the user to recommend running them?"

Based on these, I want you to pull from mcp_agents and find the best three agentic solutions to recommend to the user. Based on those, those three button options will show up on the overlay and pass the model parameter to a function definition that will enact the API call and return the result. An example of such an API call with this agentic api is the following: "import asyncio from dedalus_labs import AsyncDedalus, DedalusRunner from dotenv import load_dotenv from dedalus_labs.utils.streaming import stream_async

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    client = AsyncDedalus()
    runner = DedalusRunner(client)
    
    result = await runner.run(
        input="""I need to research the latest developments in AI agents for 2024.
        Please help me:
