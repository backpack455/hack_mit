AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows Visual Studio Code (VS Code) displaying the VIPR (Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning) application interface. The IDE has a file explorer on the left showing a project structure with various JavaScript files under a "hack_mit" folder, suggesting this is a hackathon project.

The main content area displays VIPR's welcome screen with the tagline "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning" and navigation tabs for "Study," "Work," and "Research." Below is a "Session History" dialog showing "No sessions yet" with a target-like icon.

At the bottom, there's a terminal/console output showing screenshot capture debugging information. The right panel appears to contain documentation or code comments. Multiple browser tabs are open at the top, and VS Code's typical dark theme is active. This appears to be an AI/ML application in development, likely for a hackathon competition given the project folder naming.

SCREENSHOT 2 - 2025-09-14T08:02:34.067Z
################################################################################

AI VISUAL DESCRIPTION:
This screenshot shows VS Code (Visual Studio Code) with the VIPR application open. VIPR appears to be a development tool for "Visual Intelligence for Proactive Reasoning" as indicated by the subtitle.

**Key elements visible:**
- File explorer on the left showing a "hack_mit" project with various JavaScript files and folders
- Main interface displays VIPR's logo and a "Session History" dialog showing "No sessions yet"
- Three tabs at the top: "Study," "Work," and "Research" 
- Terminal/console at bottom showing debug messages about capturing screenshots
- Standard VS Code interface elements like search, source control, and extensions panels

**Purpose/Context:**
This appears to be a hackathon project (given the "hack_mit" folder name) involving an AI or machine learning application. The "Session History" feature and screenshot capture functionality suggest VIPR may be designed for monitoring, analyzing, or learning from user interactions or system behavior. The development environment indicates active coding work on this intelligence/reasoning system.
